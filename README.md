# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to when customers stop using a company's product or service. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive measures to improve retention and reduce churn rates. 

## Key Features
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of customer churn.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visual and statistical insights into customer behavior and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts and optimizes key attributes for better predictive performance.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing one.
- **Actionable Insights**: Generates insights to support strategies for customer retention.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Churn_modelling.csv
- **Description**: The dataset contains customer demographic data, account information, and behavioral indicators.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values.
   - Encoded categorical features into numerical formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed trends and correlations in the data using visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Identified and transformed key variables influencing customer churn.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessed performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Highlighted actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting customer churn.
- Delivered meaningful insights to help businesses retain at-risk customers.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in solving real-world problems.
